# Demos
Experimenting with simple character movement input (using keyboard and mouse) and environment interaction (collision triggers).

# MobileSwipeGame
Simple mobile swipe game that tests reaction speed.
Was planning to model it similarly to Candy Crush Saga with each stage having different challenges:
  - arrow icons, unmatched arrow icons (i.e. right arrow icon on the top means you need to swipe right, not up), swipe to a specific color, math problems, etc.

# NetworkDemo
Experimenting with Unity5 built-in host to peer networking

# GamePhysics
Work in progress game physics project following Ben Tristem's Game Physics course from Udemy
