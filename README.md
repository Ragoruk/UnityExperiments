# Demos
Experimenting with simple character movement input (using keyboard and mouse) and environment interaction (collision triggers).

# MobileSwipeGame
Simple mobile swipe game that tests reaction speed.
Was planning to model it similarly to Candy Crush Saga with each stage having different challenges:
  - arrow icons, unmatched arrow icons (i.e. right arrow icon on the top means you need to swipe right, not up), swipe to a specific color, math problems, etc.

# NetworkDemo
Experimenting with Unity5 built-in host to peer networking

Attempted to create an authorative server-client model using Unity 5's builtin network manager with the host being the "authorative" server. However, found difficulties to reliably track players with their empires making interactions between players very difficult. May have to create my own network manager.
